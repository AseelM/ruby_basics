# Ruby Basics
### Qs
* what are the implicit return of built-in methods?

### Tips
* fancy trick: typing a semicolon allows ending a Ruby statement without going to a new line.

  ```class Monkey; end```

  instead of:

  ```
  class Monkey
  end
  ```
*This is a time saver when writing something very short, like an empty class or method definition.*
